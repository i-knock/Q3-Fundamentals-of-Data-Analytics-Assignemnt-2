    "- Added new sections:\n",
    "  - Introduction\n",
    "- Improved commenting and readability of code cells\n",
    "- Changed figure output formatting\n",
    "- Removed time estimation (not used)\n",
    "- Removed IPv6 calculations, as they are not needed in the final report.\n",
    "- Removed the IPv4 computations, as we use a module that takes the dataset.\n",
    "- Replaced the matrix calculation (countries by asns)\n",
    "- Recalculated best countries and ASNs using a pandas-based approach\n",
    "- Introduced best ASNs based on either hosting country or destination country (the latter is more relevant to the question)\n",
    "- RIPE dataset can now take multiple files"

    "- There might be more information in one dataset than in the other. So by combining them, we might lose information as we only take the common entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "[] b. Your response is \\\"Number of probes in the RIPE, probe and AS datasets within the EU: 60087\\\". But in this question we are not interested in a number of probes, but in the number of ASN's. Also, for this question, it is not necessary to merge the RIPE dataset, only the AS and probe datasets are sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "[] c. d. I think I have an idea what's wrong with your answer to d:  you calculated mean latency for a WHOLE COUNTRY. You should have calculated mean latency per ASN, and then choose ONE ASN PER COUNTRY (the one with smallest mean latency for ips in that country.).\n",
    "\n",
    "[] e. Taking just four best countries is no good. You should consider each possible combination of four ASN's. For each combination, measure the total latency of that combination to all countries. Pick the best combination of four ASNs.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Groote Nationale Investeer Bank (GNI Bank) is a large European bank and the bank is preparing to enter the mobile banking sector. For this project, which requires large investments, first of all, a research in the computational field is required. Considering that the locations of the datacenters to be used will directly affect the performance of the system, one of the most important research points will be the subject of the datacenter's location to be selected. GNI Bank hired our data analytics team  (Group 14). This report is an advisory report which will help to GNI Bank for making decisions about datacenter location.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem description\n",
    "The GNI bank doesn't know where the best location for a datacenter in the EU is. This will need to be determined based on their company data, making the allocation of the datacenter efficient.\n",

    "## Dataset description\n",
    "It is also important to note where the datasets come from, how they related to each other, which pieces are relevant to you and which are not. The RIPE dataset contains ping measurements executed by a select number of probes to most IPv4 addresses in the world. One day of measurements are stored in 24 files.\n",
    "The IP location dataset connects the IP's of all the data with certain locations. This dataset is relevent because it connects the other datasets to locations over the world.\n",
